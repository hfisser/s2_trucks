# Detect large moving vehicles on roads using Sentinel-2 data

This repository hosts an object detection method for large moving vehicles on roads based on the Sentinel-2 moving object effect. The objects are detected and spatially delineated (boxes). Speed and heading are calculated based on known sensor parameters and the spatial order of pixels belonging to the object.
